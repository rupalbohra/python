# Tuple is an immutable data type in python.  Immutable --> cannot change

#Creating a tuple using()
t = (1,)

# Pritinting the elements of tuple
print(t[0])

# Cannot update the values of a tuple
t[0] = 34


# Types of tuple:
t1 = ()  # empty tuple
t2 = (1,)  # tuple with single element
# wrong way to declare a tuple with single element  t = (1)  
# #if you put parenthesis with the intention of creating a tuple then you need to put comma after the element
# in the case of tuple with single element 
# to make it identifiable for the compiler.  
t3 = (1, 2, 3)
