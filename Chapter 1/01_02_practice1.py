print('''Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
How I wonder what you are!
Up above the world so high,
Like a diamond in the sky.

When the blazing sun is gone,
When he nothing shines upon,
Then you show your little light,
Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.''')

when you have multi line paragraph you cannot write it under " " rather you need to use 
triple single inverted commas.
NOTE: text written under triple single inverted commas is comment only when
used alone and when it is used with print it is a string lateral.
